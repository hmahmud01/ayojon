                    <p>Please include your name, address, and/or e-mail address when you contact us. </p>
                    <p>We encourage you to promptly update your account information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions on this site. In addition, it may be impossible to completely delete your information without retaining some residual information because of backups. </p>
                    <h3>5. User Choices on Collection and Use of Information </h3>
                    <p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our site or our other services because such information may be required in order for you to register as a subscriber; purchase products or services through our site or by phone; or initiate other transactions through us or third parties. </p>
                    <p>We may, from time to time, send you e-mail regarding our products and services. In addition, we may, from time to time, ask if you want to opt-in to receive offers or information from us and our partners, and if you opt-in we and our partners may occasionally send you e-mail, text messages and direct mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. </p>
                    <p>At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional e-mails or newsletters from us and our partners by updating your online opt-in preferences or requesting to opt-out of receiving these emails. You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional e-mail or text message communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you will have to change your preferences directly with that third party. </p>
                    <p>You also have choices with respect to cookies, as described below. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies, some parts of our site may not work properly in your case. </p>
                    <h3>6. Security of Information </h3>
                    <p>We have instituted measures to help safeguard your personal information. For example, access by you to your account is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In addition, you have the ability to grant employees, contractors, clients and other contacts access to your account; we recommend that you limit access to only those individuals whom you trust with your personal and business information. You can modify what information in your account these individuals can access in the "Settings" area of your account. Further, only authorized My Wedding Workbook employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. </p>
                    <p>In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by established third-party banking, processing agents and distribution institutions. They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process your order. In addition, when you use third-party payment processors to process credit card or ACH/e-Check payments via the Planning Pod site, those third parties will also receive the information needed to verify and authorize those transactions. </p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. You should also take care with how you handle and disclose your personal information. As a result, you acknowledge and agree that our system may not be completely secure including, but not limited to the following: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet that are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this site cannot be guaranteed; (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party and (d) you provide information to us at your sole risk. </p>
                    <h3>7. Cookies </h3>
                    <p>When you use our site we will store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use of our site. A cookie is a small data text file, which a Web site stores on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. The cookies make your use of the site easier, make the site run more smoothly and help us to maintain a secure site. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site may not work properly in that case. </p>
                    <h3>8. Privacy Policies of Third Party Sites </h3>
                    <p>This Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. For example, there are a number of places on our site where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. Other sites accessible through our site have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. We are not responsible for and shall not be liable for any third party content, advertising, products, services or the policies or practices of third parties. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting. </p>
                    <p>Additionally, other companies that place advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising through the use of cookies. We cannot control and shall not be responsible or liable for this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect. </p>
                    <h3>9. Miscellaneous Privacy Issues </h3>
                    <p>You must be at least 18 years old to have our permission to use this site. Our policy is that we do not knowingly collect, use or disclose any personal information about visitors that are under 18 years of age. </p>
