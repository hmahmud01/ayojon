By registering, Account Owners agree that all information provided in the Account Registration Data is true and accurate and that you will maintain and update this information as required in order to keep it current, complete and accurate. This is especially important with respect to your email address, since that is the primary way in which we will communicate with Account Owners about your account.</p>
                        <p>Account Owners can provide account access to other Users, and they can also give these Users permission to invite additional Users into their account. All Users are required to create a username and password in order to access the account. It is the responsibility for Account Owners and Users to maintain and update your contact information, including but not limited to email addresses, in order to keep it current, complete and accurate.

                        <p>Account Owners and Users are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your passwords and account, restricting access to your account and computer, and for any and all statements made, acts or omissions and any other activities that occur through the use of your password and account, including any email sent and any charges incurred. Therefore, Account Owners and Users must take steps to ensure that others do not gain access to your password and account. Our personnel will never ask Account Owners and Users for your password. Account Owners may not transfer your account to anyone unless you provide written approval as well as a valid proof of identity, and we reserve the right to immediately terminate your account in the event of any unauthorized transfer or sharing thereof.</p>

                        <h3>5. Fees and Payments</h3>
                        <h4>5.1 Subscriptions; Payment of Subscription Fees</h4>
                        <p>Access to the Planning Pod main site – including but not limited to the software tools available via the site - and ancillary Planning Pod sites, whether now existing or developed in the future, shall be subject to a subscription fee at the time of registration based on Planning Pod's then existing subscription fees for such services, which may be changed by us as provided in these Terms of Use.</p>
                        <p>Payment for subscription fees must be received by us by credit card or, in the case of yearly subscriptions, by personal check, cashier's check or money order prior to our acceptance of an Account Owner's subscription. For all fee-based subscription services, the Account Owner agrees to pay all fees associated with such service. For all monthly charges for fee-based subscription services, we will bill the Account Owner's credit card. For all yearly charges for fee-based subscription services, we will invoice the Account Owner and require payment by personal check, cashier's check or money order. Recurring subscription charges are billed in advance of service. The Account Owner agrees to provide us with accurate and complete billing information, including valid credit card information, your name, address and telephone number, and to provide us with any changes in such information within 10 days of the change.</p>
                        <p>At our discretion, we may offer an introductory trial subscription period with the period length and cost of the trial posted on the Planning Pod site. Upon expiration of the trial period, to continue a subscription to any fee-based services, the Account Owner will be required to pay the associated subscription fees as posted.</p>
                        <p>We accept Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit cards for all monthly subscription purchases. We accept personal check, cashier's check and money order for all yearly subscription purchases. The Account Owner represents and warrants that (i) the credit card information you supply to us is true, correct and complete, (ii) charges incurred by you will be honored by your credit card company, and (iii) you will pay charges incurred by you at the posted prices, including all applicable taxes, if any.</p>
                        <p>All payments must be in United States dollars. A current billing address must be included with every order. </p>
                        <p>If, for any reason, the Account Owner's credit card company refuses to pay the amount billed for the service, you agree that we may, at our option, suspend or terminate your subscription to the service and require you to pay the overdue amount by other means acceptable to us. We may attempt to reinstate a suspended account by running the credit card on file until a subscription payment is processed, and we may charge a fee for reinstatement of suspended or terminated accounts.</p>
                        <p>If, for any reason, the Account Owner's bank or company issuing a money order or cashier's check does not release the funds to pay the amount billed for the service, you agree that we may, at our option, suspend or terminate your subscription to the service and require you to pay the overdue amount as well as any associated fees, including but not limited to returned check fees, by other means acceptable to us. We may charge a fee for reinstatement of suspended or terminated accounts.</p>
                        <p>The Account Owner agrees that until you expressly cancel your subscription to the service, you will continue to accrue charges for which you remain responsible, even if you or your Users do not use the service. To cancel a subscription, the account owner must log into your account; click on your name in the top right corner; click on the Account/Subscription option; click on the "Cancel Account" link; and follow the instructions provided.

                        <h4>5.2 Event Registration/Ticketing Payment Collection; Fees; Refunds</h4>
                        <p>As discussed in Section 2.0 Description of Services, we may offer services relating to the ability to sell and/or distribute tickets, solicit and collect donations, sell merchandise and collect attendee registration payments for events you are organizing and/or promoting. Planning Pod offers the ability to collect credit card payments from Attendees via the third-party payment processor WePay.</p>
                        <p>We offer WePay, Inc. ("WePay") as one of our third-party payment processors. In order for you to use WePay's payment processing services, you must register with WePay as a merchant. WePay's terms of service (the "WePay Terms") explain that process, and are available here: <a href="https://go.wepay.com/terms-of-service-us" target="_blank">https://go.wepay.com/terms-of-service-us</a>.  WePay's Privacy Policy is available here:  <a href="https://go.wepay.com/privacy-policy-us" target="_blank">https://go.wepay.com/privacy-policy-us</a> By accepting these Terms, you agree that you have reviewed the WePay Terms and Privacy Policy for the country in which you are located and agree to them. Please note that we are not a party to the WePay Terms or Privacy Policy and that we have no obligations or liability to you under the WePay Terms or Privacy Policy or for any services that WePay provides to you. If you have questions regarding WePay or the WePay Terms or Privacy Policy, please contact WePay at <a href="https://support.wepay.com/hc/en-us" target="_blank">https://support.wepay.com/hc/en-us</a>.</p>
                        <p>If Account Owners or Users choose to collect credit card payments from Attendees, Planning Pod and our third-party processors will assess standard fees to each credit card transaction at the time of payment, which you agree to pay in full. These fees may include but are not limited to transaction fees, service fees, processing fees and royalties, and they will be assessed when an Attendee submits their registration and payment details. Such fees are posted elsewhere on this site, and we reserve the right to change these fees at any time. Account Owners and Users can elect to absorb these fees into the price of each registration/ticket (in which case the fees will be deducted from the listed price of each registration/ticket at the time of purchase) or to pass these fees onto Attendees (in which case the fees will be added to the listed price of each registration/ticket at the time of purchase and will be paid by the Attendee). Planning Pod does not assess standard fees for free registrations/tickets.</p>
                        <p>The payout procedures - including payout waiting periods - for credit card payments that have been collected are set by our third-party payment processors and may be posted elsewhere on this site as a convenience. These payout procedures are subject to change without notice from the third-party processors, and as such we do not warrant that the payout information posted on this site is accurate, complete or free from errors. Payouts will be made minus any standard fees as described above. We and our third-party payment processors reserve the right to hold registration/ticket payments in reserve if we deem it necessary based on potential fraud, refund, chargeback or other types of risk and to release held funds at our discretion.</p>
                        <p>We may also allow Account Owners and Users to track manual check and cash payments from attendees as well as, to the extent available, provide a record of payments from attendees. We do not warrant that these records are accurate, complete, reliable, current or free of errors.</p>
                        <p>For all registration/ticket payments collected, Account Owners and Users are responsible for payment and reporting of any applicable taxes. We accept no responsibility or obligation to assess the applicability of taxes or to collect and report any such taxes.</p>
                        <p>With regard to refunds, it is the sole discretion of Account Owners and Users to make refunds available for registration/ticket payments made by your Attendees, with the exception that you must provide a full refund or similar make-good to Attendees if you are unable to provide the services and merchandise you have advertised and/or promoted through Planning Pod (such as in the case of a cancelled event). Account Owners and/or Users are required to and agree to post refund policies in the allotted area of the registration page (even if you opt for a "No Refund" policy), including but not limited to details on if and/or how attendees can request a refund, expected response time to refund requests, and refund timelines and deadlines.</p>
                        <p>To facilitate refund requests, Planning Pod provides functionality for Attendees to view their registration/ticket details and, if refunds are being offered, request a refund. Once a refund is requested, it is the responsibility of the Account Owner and/or Users and the Attendee to resolve any disputes arising from the purchase and sale of registrations, tickets and merchandise, and Planning Pod is under no obligation to serve as an intermediary or to resolve such disputes.</p>
                        <p>For information on chargebacks on registration/ticket payments, consult the WePay Terms of Service at: <a href="https://go.wepay.com/terms-of-service-us" target="_blank">https://go.wepay.com/terms-of-service-us</a>. If excessive refunds or chargebacks are made on registration/ticket payments, we reserve the right to investigate such instances, cease registration and ticketing for any event, terminate accounts and assist third-party payment providers to obtain appropriate reimbursement by any lawful means.</p>
